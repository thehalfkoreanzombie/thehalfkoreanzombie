### Hello Everyone! My name is Alex Wallace, and welcome to my github profile ðŸ‘‹

I am a data engineer hailing from Vancouver, WA. I graduated with a BA in psychology at the University of Portland and later graduated from the data management cohort at Datastack Academy. I played Division I tennis at University of Portland, and during my tenure, we won conference for the first time in school history. In that year, I went 17-4 at #4 singles. I am now retired from tennis, but enjoy bowling, golf, and MMA. I also make my own music, which you can find [Here](https://k41ro.com/links). I am a passionate data engineer that can create ETL/ELT pipelines along with data visualizations to tell the story of your data in a consumer-friendly manner. I'm also very interested in incorporating AI into my data projects, creating GPTs to better handle datasets and provide information from said datasets. 

- Feel free to reach me at thehalfkoreanzombie@gmail.com. I look forward to any and all inquiries!

### Projects

### [MTG Deck Wizard](https://github.com/thehalfkoreanzombie/MTG-Deck-Wizard)

<img src="https://github.com/thehalfkoreanzombie/thehalfkoreanzombie/assets/146976819/a0d549e9-d628-474a-8fce-52dd4a13203c" alt="drawing" width="200"/>


- MTG Deck Wizard is a custom GPT I created that can build you a deck that is legal for the MTG 2024 standard rotation. This GPT can extract card information from a standard cards dataset and use the data to build your deck using new cards that chatGPT doesn't have in its memory

### [Airflow Party Time!](https://github.com/thehalfkoreanzombie/Airflow-Party-Time)

- Airflow Party Time is a project I built using airflow decorators to create functions with passable variables. This DAG takes a plethora of votes on cake flavors, reads them, counts the flavor with the most votes and tells you the flavor. The setup instructions in this project's README will also take you through the steps to help you set up an airflow project yourself.

### [Airline ETL](https://github.com/thehalfkoreanzombie/Airline-ETL)

- Airline ETL is a full ETL pipeline I created to load tables into BigQuery. I first organized the tables using an ERD, and then subsequently transformed and uploaded them into BigQuery using a pipeline I built in Python. The tables in this project have data pertaining to all prevalent airlines.

### [DBT Tutorial](https://github.com/thehalfkoreanzombie/dbt-tutorial)

- DBT Tutorial is an ELT pipeline I created using DBT. In this project, I followed the DBT tutorial and created the project that helped me get my DBT LinkedIn badge.
